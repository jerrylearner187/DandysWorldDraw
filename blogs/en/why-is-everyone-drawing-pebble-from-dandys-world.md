## Who (or What) Is Pebble?

Pebble is one of the five main characters in *Dandy’s World*, a game that has been making waves since his addition on June 14, 2024. Imagine a tiny, lovable rock that decided to become a dog and join a video game. That’s Pebble for you! His dark gray body with fractured textures, lighter gray legs, and those hollow clover-like cheek designs scream *“I’m cute, but also mysterious!”* Oh, and let’s not forget his giant white eyes that could melt even the coldest of gamer hearts.

In the game, Pebble is ranked as a C-tier character (ouch), but don’t let that fool you! His abilities make him a stealthy distractor, perfect for avoiding enemies called Twisteds. Sure, he might not be the MVP of *Dandy’s World*, but he’s definitely the MVP of our hearts. 🐾
